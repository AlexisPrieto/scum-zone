<p><strong><span class="orange">Coming soon:</span> PvP Zone!
  </strong></p>
<p>Looking for a fight? The server will pick a different town every day.
  Kills inside the zone count on the leaderboard. You can still be
  killed outside the PvP Zone but it doesn't count towards your monthly
  total.</p>
<p>This is a SCUM league. We keep the server size small so there is no
  lag. Top ranked players are auto-whitelisted so you can join even when
  the server is full. You will always know exactly where to find the
  action, since the server will randomly choose a new bunker/town for us
  to fight over every day.</p>
<p>Rankings are based on the ELO system, like a chess tournament. Kills
  &amp; deaths are treated like wins &amp; losses. The scores reflect
  actual skill, not a simple kill-count or fame points.</p>
