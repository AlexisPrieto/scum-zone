<h2>The PvP Zone</h2>
<p>Looking for a fight? Go to the <a href="/map">PvP Zone</a>. It moves to a
  different town every 24 hours, so we have a new place to fight every day.</p>
<p>Inside the PvP Zone, kills and deaths count towards
  <a href="">your ranking</a>. Kills outside the zone don't count towards the
  rankings. But you still die.</p>
<h2>Ranking Info</h2>
<p>The rankings are generated by
  <a href="https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/">a program</a> used to
  rank chess tournaments, using the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ELO system</a>.
  It measures skill by looking at who killed who. You get more points for
  fighting high-ranked players.</p>
<p>This system is not perfect, but we hope it works better than raw
  kill-count or fame points, which are easy to exploit. The only way to win
  is to fight other high ranking players. Players gain little to nothing from
  various team-killing schemes. There is no way to "farm" skill points.</p>
