Feel free to use or adapt the tools to your own SCUM server's needs!

## SCUM Game Server Admin Tools

This package provides access to your SCUM game server logs. Yes, really! This
helps SCUM game server admins do their jobs.

To run the backend, update `config.js` then run

```
node update.js
```

The script logs in to your SCUM game server control panel to read the logs, the
same way you usually do by hand. Except automated!

To run a copy of the website locally, run

```
sudo node server.js
```
